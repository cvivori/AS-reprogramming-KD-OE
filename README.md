# AS-reprogramming-KD-OE
Analysis of the AS changes in MEF reprogramming regulated by the knockdown of CPSF3/hnRNP UL1 or by the overexpression of TIA1.

**00. Run vast-tools**
- Dataset available in GEO Database:

**01. Define sets of CPSF3/UL1/TIA1-dependent and -independent AS events**

**02. Study CPSF3/UL1/TIA1-dependent and -independent AS events**
- Sequence features and RNA-binding protein motif enrichment analysis with Matt
- Enrichment of senescence/SASP-associated genes in GO terms enriched in TIA1-dependent AS exons.
